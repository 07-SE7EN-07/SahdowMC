[05:58:26] [Server thread/INFO]: [BetterRevive] Spigot and forks API are really similar and should be compatible, however there are
[05:58:26] [Server thread/INFO]: [BetterRevive] some cases in which they aren't compatible. If you have issues report them to the
[05:58:26] [Server thread/INFO]: [BetterRevive] developer instead of reviewing 1 star. Thanks in advanced!
