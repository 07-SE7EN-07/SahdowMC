[00:32:55] [Server thread/INFO]: [BetterRevive] You are using a Paper fork (Paper). This plugin was made for Spigot
[00:32:55] [Server thread/INFO]: [BetterRevive] but was (in most cases) tested with different builds of Paper and Purpur.
[00:32:55] [Server thread/INFO]: [BetterRevive] Spigot and forks API are really similar and should be compatible, however there are
[00:32:55] [Server thread/INFO]: [BetterRevive] some cases in which they aren't compatible. If you have issues report them to the
[00:32:55] [Server thread/INFO]: [BetterRevive] developer instead of reviewing 1 star. Thanks in advanced!
